# Welcome
Welcome to the <span class='branding'>brainbox</span> documentation and the awesome world of **IoT**.
<br>
<br>
The starting point for *Internet of Things* applications are the things themselves.
<span class='branding'>brainbox</span> allows anyone to graphically create new unlimited interactions
between this connected objects within a simple web-browser without knowing coding or hacking.

## Easy To Use

## What the brainbox is NOT
<span class='branding' >brainbox</span> is not a (yet another) new home automation server. It's purpose
is to cover key components of networking, IoT and digital circuits to ensure that you understand how to connect
device to the Internet with fun.

</span>
<span  class='secondary' markdown='1'>
 <span class='branding' >brainbox</span> provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to
 wire  things together using the wide range of nodes in the palette. The created files, named *brains*, can be then
 deployed to the runtime in  a single-click. New JavaScript based nodes, named *blocs* can be created within the web based
 designer.

## Connectivity

### USB

Do you want to add wireless capability to your project? Using the NRF24L01+ module is a very easy and
reliable way to do so. This transceiver module works at the 2.4GHz band and it is extremely easy to use with
any Arduino board and <span class='branding' >brainbox</span>. Download the ready to use Arduino sketches and
connect the wires and you are ready to use them within the browser base editor.<br><br>*You can find detailed
information how to setup the RF24 or the arduino in the platform section of this documentation*
